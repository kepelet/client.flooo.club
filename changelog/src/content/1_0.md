![flo 1.0](../assets/1.0.jpg)

this version was tested on:

- navidrome version: [0.52.5](https://github.com/navidrome/navidrome/releases/tag/v0.52.5)
- ios version: [17.6](https://support.apple.com/en-us/118723)

## PSA

flo is still under heavy development. bugs are expected and reports are encouraged to make flo better for everyone!

this is a semi-public beta version, and installing TestFlight is required in order to use it. if you prefer the App Store version, just wait a little longer until late Fall! the TestFlight version likely won't harm your iPhone or your Navidrome server.

---

in this version you can expect basic functionality for a music player: **it plays music.** a [Navidrome](https://navidrome.org) server is required as this app is a Navidrome client. if you don't have one, you can use the [demo version](https://www.navidrome.org/demo/) provided by the Navidrome community.

some features you may enjoy:

- online streaming (save your storage)
- offline streaming (save your bandwidth)
- play by album (shuffle for surprises)
- background playback (just don't close the app)
- control playback via the "command center" (something in your "notification")

## ðŸ‘¾ Known Issues

- after 24h or so, the "JWT token" expires. for now, the screen will display the exact message, and the best thing you can do is re-login (logout -> login). i have a workaround for this but it's still under the experimental flag
- sometimes the "timestamp" in the app and the command center differs by 1-3s. while this thing doesn't affect your listening experience, it's still annoying though
- in dark mode, the text on the login screen is slightly unreadable. if you're having trouble reading the text, try logging in with dark mode turned off :D
- the "album image(s)" sometimes don't load especially if you're on a slow network. i'm still working on a fix for this
