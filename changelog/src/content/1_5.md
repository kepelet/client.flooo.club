![flo 1.5](../assets/1.5.jpg)

This version was tested on:
- Navidrome version: [0.53.2](https://github.com/navidrome/navidrome/releases/tag/v0.53.2)
- iOS version: [18.2](https://support.apple.com/en-us/121161)

There are no new features in this version as promised, and it only contains some bug fixes that help make flo more reliable, specifically for downloads. Here are some details:

**First**, flo now performs concurrent downloads using 50% of your available CPU. This means if your iPhone has 6 CPU cores, flo will limit downloads to 3 songs **at the same time**. While this makes downloads relatively slower, it makes them more reliable and keeps your CPU usage at a reasonable level.

**Second**, flo now retries failed downloads up to 3 times. This addresses my specific issue, but it should help anyone else in similar situations. In rare cases, specifically during downloads, flo may fail to connect to the Navidrome server and show a "timed out" error. The issue might be related to the reverse proxy or flo itself. While I have no issues when connecting directly to the Navidrome server, problems (sometimes) occur when connecting via CDN services like Cloudflare (in my case). Nevertheless, these fixes won't negatively impact or slow down anyone, especially when connections are always successful.

**Third**, flo now uses less memory during downloads. The tradeoff is increased disk I/O rates during downloads, which should be fine given the new concurrent download limits.

## üçø New Features & Enhancements

Nothing new as promised, just enjoy the boredom!

## üêû Bug Fixes

- "Listening Activity" is no longer cleared when "Optimize local storage" is triggered, as it now has a dedicated action for this purpose
- Fixed minor UI-related spacing issues that appeared on actual devices but not in the simulator
- Downloads now use less CPU & Memory
- Downloads are automatically retry-able now

## üíé Supporters

I'd like to personally thank [Sid](https://github.com/SindreKjelsrud) for his generous support in making flo better! Sid helps by [reporting bugs](https://github.com/kepelet/flo/issues?q=label%3Abug), proposing [new features](https://github.com/kepelet/flo/issues?q=label%3Aenhancement), and [sponsoring my work](https://github.com/sponsors/faultables) via GitHub Sponsor. I also welcome everyone to contribute, as I can't make flo better for everyone on my own!

## üëÄ Coming Soon

We can't spill all the beans just yet, but we're thrilled to give you a sneak peek of what's coming in the next flo release:
- **Scrobbles**: Track your listening history to Last.fm or ListenBrainz, just like Navidrome Web UI
- **Offline playlist**: *Gotta make my "night ride" playlist play offline*
- **Download indicators**: So you know what's downloading and the ETA
- **flo for macOS/iPadOS**: Save your phone battery, bring your music anywhere, to any device you want. Linux support is on the table (currently I use `curl + jq + fzf + awk + xargs + ffmpeg`, because, why not)

Anyway, happy new year!
