this version was tested on:

## 🍿 New Features & Enhancements

- Localization support (currently EN and ID)

## 🐞 Bug Fixes

- Fetch server information after login successful
- Minor "race condition" when downloading albums causing songs downloaded to the wrong album
- Song list now sorted by the track number

## 👾 Known Issues

- after 24h or so, the "JWT token" expires. for now, the screen will display the exact message, and the best thing you can do is re-login (logout -> login). i have a workaround for this but it's still under the experimental flag
- sometimes the "timestamp" in the app and the command center differs by 1-3s. while this thing doesn't affect your listening experience, it's still annoying though
- in dark mode, the text on the login screen is slightly unreadable. if you're having trouble reading the text, try logging in with dark mode turned off :D
- the "album image(s)" sometimes don't load especially if you're on a slow network. i'm still working on a fix for this
