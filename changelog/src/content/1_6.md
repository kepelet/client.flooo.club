![flo 1.6](../assets/1.6.jpg)

This version was tested on:
- Navidrome version: [0.53.3](https://github.com/navidrome/navidrome/releases/tag/v0.53.3)
- iOS version: [18.2](https://support.apple.com/en-us/121161)

The first "major" release in 2025!

## üçø New Features & Enhancements

- Scrobbles: Track your listening history to Last.fm or ListenBrainz, just like Navidrome Web UI
- Offline playlist: Bring your favorite playlist offline!
- Download indicators: Track your downloads, never guessing ever again XD
- Redefined album screen: Love your screen real estate

## üêû Bug Fixes

- Downloaded album with no downloaded song is no longer displayed
- Login button is now disabled when you're logging in

## üî© QoL Improvements

- flo will show "friendly message" when you try using `http://` based server
- Navidrome's default "album cover art placeholder" is used when loading the album cover or when accessing a playlist
- flo will try displaying "Album Artist" instead of the regular "Artist" and show the artist's name in the song list. This is important for "Various Artists" or "Compilations" and notably, playlists
- If you're downloading tracks, you'll see a badge in the "Download" tab to tell you the number of undownloaded tracks
