## 👾 Known Issues

- after 24h or so, the "JWT token" expires. for now, the screen will display the exact message, and the best thing you can do is re-login (logout -> login). i have a workaround for this but it's still under the experimental flag
- in dark mode, the text on the login screen is slightly unreadable. if you're having trouble reading the text, try logging in with dark mode turned off :D
